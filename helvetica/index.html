            The Neue Haas Grotesk typeface was designed by Eduard Hoffmann and Max Miedinger. At the time of its
            creation, Hoffmann was the president of the Haas Type Foundry in Switzerland. He hired Max Miedinger, a
            former employee of the Haas Type Foundry who had become a freelance designer. Miedinger was a gifted
            salesman as well as a designer, and together they began the creation of a new typeface: Neue Haas Grotesk.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the mid 1950's the Haas Type Foundry started to notice a decrease in their typeface sales. Hoffmann
            decided that he needed to create a new typeface that would be more successful than the previous typefaces.
            He reached out and hired the former Haas designer and salesman Max Miedinger. Then the two started work on a
            new typeface in 1956. For the next few months the two were busy comparing their drawings and proofs to old
            grotesk typefaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            These include typefaces like Akzidenz-Grotesk, Franz√∂sische Grotesk, and Normal-Grotesk, all of which had
            all been popular among Swiss designers. The typeface that was created had horizontal stroke terminals, a
            large x-height, and very tight spacing. These features together resulted in the typeface being dense and
            having a sturdy texture. Upon Neue Haas Grotesk's release, in 1957, it also became widely popular. The Neue
            Haas Grotesk typeface was first shown at Graphic 57, an exhibition of the graphic design industry that took
            place at the Palais de Beaulieu, in Lausanne, Switzerland. At the start it was only available to hand set
            type, but in 1959 it was made available to use for the popular Linotype machine.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name Neue Haas Grotesk was not suited for the marketplace and so the name was changed to Helvetica. The
            name change made sense as the Neue Haas Grotesk typeface had been significantly changed when converted to
            machine type. Helvetica has become one of the most popular and well known typefaces that many use today.
