            Akzidenz-Grotesk is a sans-serif typeface family originally released by the Berthold Type Foundry of Berlin.
            "Akzidenz" indicates its intended use as a typeface for commercial print runs such as publicity, tickets and
            forms, as opposed to fine printing, and "grotesque" was a standard name for sans-serif typefaces at the
            time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originating during the late nineteenth century, Akzidenz-Grotesk belongs to a tradition of general-purpose,
            unadorned sans-serif types that had become dominant in German printing during the nineteenth century.
            Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the post-war
            period as the preferred typeface of many Swiss graphic designers in what became called the "International"
            or "Swiss" design style which became popular across the Western world in the 1950s and 1960s. Its simple,
            neutral design has also influenced many later typefaces. It has sometimes been sold as Standard in
            English-speaking countries, and a variety of digital versions have been released by Berthold and other
            companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Akzidenz-Grotesk is often translated into English as "jobbing sans-serif", "jobbing" in the sense of "used
            for jobs". Both words were everyday, descriptive terms for typefaces of the time in the German language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Akzidenz means some occasion or event (in the sense of "something that happens", not in the sense of a
            high-class social event or occasion) and was therefore used as a term for trade printing; Akzidenzschrift
            was by the 1870s a generic term meaning typefaces intended for these uses. A modern German-language
            dictionary describes it as work such as advertisements and forms.[5][6] The origin of the word is Latin
            accidentia, defined by Lewis and Short as "that which happens, a casual event, a chance".
